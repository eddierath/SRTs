00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,340
Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,230
I am Marcelo Matiello,
Assistant Professor

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,400
of Neurology at Harvard Medical School
and In-Inpatient Medical Director

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,740
at MGH Neurology.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,920
Today, we will talk about
altered mental status

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,590
encephalopathies, which is a very common
cause of consultations in the hospital.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,350
So now let's move to the slides.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,680
So today, we will cover the
definition of altered mental status,

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,700
encephalopathy, and
delirium, and highlight

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,450
the differences of such definitions.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,760
We will present the elements of
basic and advanced diagnostic workup

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,340
in cases of altered mental status.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,930
And finally, we will discuss most
common and key uncommon causes

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,440
of altered mental status
that are seen by neurology

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,550
consultants in the hospital.

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,010
Today, we will start with a case.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,760
And throughout the talk,
we will have moments

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,610
in which we will check knowledge and the
questions will be related to this case.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,870
So I ask the attention
to the simple history

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,650
that we will present for you here.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,620
So the case is of a 65-year-old man.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,350
He was found by friends and was brought
to the ED with mental confusion.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,680
At the time he was brought
by EMS to the emergency room,

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,330
he had no family member with him.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,280
We learned by calling the
friends that two weeks ago he

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,960
experienced the onset of fluctuating
disorientation and forgetfulness.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,860
And he also had some strange
behaviors, such as trying

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,490
to brush his teeth with his cell phone.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,640
In the emergency room, the
vital signs were normal

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,490
and the neuro exam was non focal.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,680
There were no meningeal signs.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,300
The blood counts, the basic
metabolic panel, and the toxic screen

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,640
was negative.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,860
So let's start by defining
consciousness or mental status.

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,240
Consciousness is a combination
of arousal and content.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,600
Arousal refers to the
level of alertness.

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,390
Pathologic states of
arousal range anywhere

39
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,890
from coma, a state of
complete unresponsiveness

40
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,710
without any eye opening, to drowsiness,
in which a patient is arousable

41
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,940
but needs the stimulations
to stay awake.

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,220
Arousal is maintained by
various systems in the brain

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,400
and includes networks of neurons
in the brain stem, hypothalamus,

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,340
basal forebrain, thalamus, and
a number of cortex projections.

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,960
As you see here in our schematic
view, many different centers

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,195
are working together to
keep the brain awake.

47
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,720


48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,680
Consciousness also
includes the content--

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,720
the content of the mind.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,260
That refers to the high
level cortical processing

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,010
that allows for awareness
of self and environment,

52
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:23,350
and enables the interaction of a
human being with the environment.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,310
The contents of the
consciousness is carried, again,

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,780
by many specific cortical
regions in neuronal networks.

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,390
For instance, as you are
seeing here in this figure,

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,290
there are areas of the
cortex, they are focused

57
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,800
on producing language, understanding
language, planning, decoding,

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,780
visual stimuli, and so on.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,450


60
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,760
Now let's go on to more of the clinical
definition of altered mental status.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,750
This is a term that is broadly defined
as a change of the cognitive function

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,880
or level of consciousness.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,940
As you're seeing here,
it's a very inclusive term

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,500
and describes patients that have
either a change of the content,

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,885
of the level of arousal, or both.

66
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,510


67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,920
Encephalopathy is more
of a specific term

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,000
that is used in some
cases interchangeably

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,590
with altered mental status,
and implies the diffuse process

70
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,980
causing change in consciousness.

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,180
Finally, another term that
is very commonly used--

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,440
delirium.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,670
It's even a more specific term
and it refers to the acute change

74
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,380
in mental status characterized
by a deficit in attention

75
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,310
and the fluctuating course
with disorganized thinking

76
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,600
and/or change in arousal.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,634
And now let's take a brief
pause to test your knowledge.

78
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:58,134
